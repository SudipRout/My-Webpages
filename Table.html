        <h2>Duelist</h2>
        <section>
            Duelist are self-sufficient and confident(rather overconfident most times) entry-fraggers
            who are ready to take intense fights through their skills(if they have) and abilities.

        <h2>Controller</h2>
        <section>
            Controllers are expert at set up dangerous territories to set their team up for success
            (And the most common, most used and surprisingly their signature ability is...just...just...SMOKES...Duhh!)

        <h2>Initiator</h2>
        <section>
            Initiators challenge angles by setting up their team to enter contested ground and push
            defenders away!(Really? That's what she said but actually they are quite expert to play from any angle,
            with their abilities they can make most situations under their control)

        <h2>Sentinal</h2>
        <section>
            Sentinels are defensive experts who can lock down areas both attacking and defensive sides,
            basically they are the laziest ^_^ but most supportive for other teammates because of their abilities.
